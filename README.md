Project documentation for the **Design for Physical Prototyping** course 2022/23 focusing on the topic of **Uncomfortable Devices**.

## Abstract

This project builds upon an idea we came up with after several brainstorming sessions. The main object of Saltapult - a smart (at least in some way) laundry basket - is to detect if and how much dirty cloth a user has thrown into it. For each new piece, the user gets insulted. A full basket results in an epic launch that wakes the user up, unexpected, in the best case. This paper will guide the reader through all processes of the project, from the early concept and motivation, to the different testing states/implementations, our first prototype, building the final prototype, the presentation and finally to our conclusion.
