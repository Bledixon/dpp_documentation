# Saltapult

Project documentation for the **Design for Physical Prototyping** course 2022/23 focusing on the topic of **Uncomfortable Devices**.

## Abstract

Shortly summarize the intentions and ideas behind your project. 
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. This project builds upon the idea of [Chind≈çgu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chind%C5%8Dgu), the practice of inventing ingenious everyday gadgets that seem to be ideal solutions to particular problems, but which may cause more problems than they solve. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

## Concept

The initial brainstorming in the DPP course paved the road for the Saltinator. While the first ideas where rather tame, it didn't take long to end up with some crazy concepts which are impossible with current technology. But this information dumping helped with coming up with something that was actually buildable.

After a private remote session we reduced our possible candidates to three ideas.
* A hairdryer attachment that insults you when you use the highest setting.
* A odorizant that tells you about their feelings and what kind of problems they are facing currently.
* A self driving vacuum cleaner that insults you and some other features that have been lost in translation.
* A date buddy that analyzes your breath and sprays peppermint breath refresher accordingly.
* ... and finally a laundary basket that throws the laundary back at you once it's full and also keeps insulting you.

In retrospect it's pretty clear that the "insulting" part was our main driver for most ideas, which most likely pairs with that fact that the idea of an insulting machine seems uncomfortable at first, but in the end it's actually quite the opposite. We insult each other all the time, it's a form of comedy and it's especially hard to convey these often highly emotional outbursts through cheap speakers and with no facial impressions.

### Underlying Motivation

The laundary basket is an object that gets way too full and never fully cleared, which is a problem. To solve this, the Saltinator not only limits the amount of dirty laundary that can be placed inside, but also reminds the user by tossing all it's contents once it's too full. To further make the user uncomfortable, it insults them everytime they place an item in the basket. The individual user can freely device where this device makes the most sense, especially since it's somewhat space-saving.

### The Initial Plan

The biggest issue was conceptualizing how the launching mechanism works. Due to the box shape we did not want to use a vertical approach. So instead we first theorized over using secondary wooden plate that is pulled towards a motor using a rope which gets cut, causing the launch. The springs were located in the bottom. To reduce the stress on the rope and motor we also wanted to fixate the moving plate using some sort of mechanism, which required a good chunk of research. If the motor did not bring enough torque we would have oppted for a more used centered approach, having the user fixate the plate. Another problem that came up immediately was using the razor, as the rope needs to be replaced, either automatically or by the user. For the indication we initially planned on using an infrared sensor that checks if the signal is interrupted. If the interruption is short it will play an insult. A longer time period will trigger the launch sequence.

## Implementation

- Sebi

Describe how you implemented your project. Which iterations did go through? What did work and what did not work? Did you adapt your original idea to practical difficulties during implementation?

### Iteration A
